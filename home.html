      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As the solo developer of this application, I've crafted a simple yet
        engaging game where users predict whether the next city will be hotter
        or colder. The journey of creating this app was meticulous and
        deliberate, adhering closely to the principles of software development.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>User Controls</h2>
      <p>
        Three primary controls were implemented to provide a straightforward
        user interface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A button to guess if the next city is hotter.</li>
        <li>A button to guess if the next city is colder.</li>
        <li>A submit button to save the high score with the user's name.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>State Persistence</h2>
      <p>
        Ensuring that the application retains its state was paramount. By
        leveraging <code>SharedPreferences</code>, the high scores and user
        names persist across sessions, providing a seamless experience for
        returning players.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adherence to D.R.Y. Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the development process, I was vigilant in my efforts to
        adhere to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (D.R.Y.) principles. Functions
        were crafted to handle repetitive tasks such as fetching weather data
        and storing high scores, which streamlined the codebase and prevented
        redundancy.
