      <h1>Project Documentation: Higher or Lower Weather Game</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        As the solo developer of this application, I've crafted a simple yet
        engaging game where users predict whether the next city will be hotter
        or colder. One might call this a a budget knockoff of the famous "Higher
        or Lower" game based on google search results. The journey of creating
        this app was meticulous and deliberate, adhering closely to the
        principles of software development. This journey was also not the one I
        originally started. I was building an app capable of accessing
        historical weather data and I had done a significant amount of UI work
        done when I discovered the historical data is being pay-walled as a
        premium feature of my selected API.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I had more time I would make the UI more colorful and add a few
        animations to give the game a little life. The optimimum product for
        this would include a much larger variety of locations as well as extra
        information such as the current time of day at said location and
        pictures that showoff the best parts of those locations, .

      <h2>User Controls</h2>
      <p>
        Three primary controls were implemented to provide a straightforward
        user interface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A button to guess if the next city is hotter.</li>
        <li>A button to guess if the next city is colder.</li>
        <li>A submit button to save the high score with the user's name.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>API Usage</h2>
      <p>
        I manually entered a list of some of the cities I have either already
        visited or plan to visit one day, this acts as a dummy dataset and gives
        the application a variety of cities it can randomly choose from. The
        OpenWeather API takes the name of a city and returns me the temperature
        in Kelvin which I then convert and display in Fahrenheit. The reason I
        chose Fahrenheit is not because it is the default unit of measure in
        USA, but because it allows for better game values as compared to
        Celsius, in which case the difference between temperatures would not
        seem that significant. While this would be accomplished even better
        using the much higher values of Kelvin, I have never met a living soul
        that regulary uses Kevlin in their daily like for weather purposes. And
        for that reason, Kelvin is out. The program randomly selects 2 cities
        from the available pool and compares the weather data for them, and asks
        the user the Question of which is hotter or colder. The game can
        technically keep on going infitely as long as you keep answering
        correctly.

      <h2>State Persistence</h2>
      <p>
        Ensuring that the application retains its state was paramount. A game
        must care enough to remember the player's best scores. By leveraging
        <code>SharedPreferences</code>, the high scores and user names persist
        across sessions, providing a seamless experience for returning players.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Adherence to D.R.Y. Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the development process, I was vigilant in my efforts to
        adhere to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (D.R.Y.) principles. Functions
        were crafted to handle repetitive tasks such as fetching weather data
        and storing high scores, which streamlined the codebase and prevented
        redundancy.
